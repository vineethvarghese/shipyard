# Artifact templates

Templates for everything under `.ai/` in the target repository. These files are **agent-generated**: discovery and
the architect draft them from repository evidence, then the human edits and decides. Never hand a human a blank
template and ask them to fill in fifty fields.

Every material fact carries an assumption label: `SPECIFIED`, `DERIVED`, `ASSUMED` or `UNRESOLVED`.

## Who writes what

| File | Writer (enforced by the write-scope hook) |
|---|---|
| `state.json`, `PROJECT.md` status/parameters/phase log, `PLAN.HUMAN.md`, `EVIDENCE.md`, `REVIEW.HUMAN.md`, `FINDINGS.json`, `returns/`, ADR-000 and the short-form grill ADRs | coordinator |
| `PROJECT.md` body, `GLOSSARY.md`, `CONSUMERS.md`, `planning/discovery.md`, `planning/concepts.md`, `planning/assumptions.md`, `planning/open-questions.md` | discovery |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INVARIANTS.md`, `decisions/**`, `formal/**`, `planning/architect.md` | architect |
| `DELIVERY_PLAN.md`, `slices/*/SLICE.md`, `planning/planner.md` | planner |
| `slices/<id>/TEST_PLAN.md` (always as `DRAFT`) | verifier |
| The `Status: DRAFT` → `Status: APPROVED` line of `TEST_PLAN.md`, nothing else | code-reviewer |
| `planning/<agent-name>.md`, `slices/<id>/findings/<agent-name>[.test-plan].md` | that reviewer |

The coordinator may also update slice `State:` lines, the slice table in `DELIVERY_PLAN.md`, and
`## Pending human approval` and `## Human change requests` in `SLICE.md`, because it owns state transitions and the
channel to the human.

## Audience banner: the first line of every `.ai/` file

The file name and the first line both say who reads it. Use exactly one of these:

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
```

```markdown
> 👤 HUMAN: read this. ~<N> min. Decision needed: <one line>.
```

Only files named `*.HUMAN.md` carry the 👤 banner. They have a hard cap of one screen (~40 lines). Lead with the
decision and the recommendation. Use no tables wider than the screen and no detail that only matters to an agent. If
the human needs it, it is in the file. If they don't, it isn't.

`state.json` and `FINDINGS.json` are JSON and carry no banner.

## `state.json`: machine state (coordinator only)

Read by every hook and by resume. Valid against `contracts/state.schema.json`. Write it only through
`python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/shipyard_state.py"` (`init`, `show`, `set-status`, `set-slice`;
`ignore-ai`, `snapshot` and `restore` manage where `.ai/` lives in git), never by hand, so it always validates.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "project": "<name>",
  "status": "INTAKE",
  "featureBranch": "feature/x",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "protectedBranches": ["main", "master"],
  "activeSlice": null,
  "sliceBranch": null,
  "brainstormBreadth": 1
}
```

- `status` is the `PROJECT.md` status, always the same value.
- `protectedBranches` holds `main`, `master`, the repository's default branch, and any branch the human named at P0.
- `activeSlice` / `sliceBranch` are set before `/shipyard:slice` launches (`"03"`, `"feature/x-slice-03"`) and
  cleared to `null` after the slice merges.
- `notesBranch` is the branch `shipyard_state.py snapshot` commits `.ai/` to (default `<featureBranch>-shipyard`).
- `state.json`, like all of `.ai/`, never enters a work branch: `.ai/` is ignored there through `.git/info/exclude`
  and committed only to the notes branch (`branch-policy.md`), so it stays put while the coordinator switches
  between the slice and feature branches.

## `PLAN.HUMAN.md`: the plan-approval brief (P8)

The coordinator writes this from `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DELIVERY_PLAN.md`, the assumptions and ADR-000, and presents
the same content in chat. It summarises; it does not restate.

```markdown
> 👤 HUMAN: read this. ~3 min. Decision needed: approve the delivery plan, or change something below.

# <project>: plan approval

**Recommendation:** APPROVE | CHANGE <what>. <one sentence why>

## What we will build                  <= 5 lines, outcomes not mechanics; the chosen concept from ADR-000
## Slices                              one line each: <id> <title>: <why it comes in this order>
## Decisions you are approving         <= 5; each: decision / the alternative rejected / why. Include the seams
                                       the tests will observe each slice through (from `## Seams under test`):
                                       approving the plan approves the seams.
## Properties you are relying on       <= 5 lines, only when C-10 is above none: INV id, one-line meaning, tier
                                       (invariants | property-tested | model-checked, bounded N steps) and status;
                                       a VIOLATED model names the ADR that redesigned it. NONE when C-10 is none.
## Risks you are accepting             <= 5 ASSUMED facts with material risk-if-wrong, unanswered P0 defaults,
                                       planner exception requests, any model NOT_RUN; NONE if none
## Cost so far and expected            one line against C-9
## Questions for you now               only ones that change the plan; NONE if none
```

## `PROJECT.md`

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.

## Scope
## Delivery parameters        <-- answers to the P0 gate, verbatim, each with an ID
| ID | Parameter | Value | Label |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| C-1 | Slice budget | <n, or "no cap stated"> | SPECIFIED / ASSUMED |

## Stakeholders
## Constraints
## Relevant repositories and services
## Known dependencies
## Key terminology            <one line: "See GLOSSARY.md", which is the source of truth for every project term>
## Framework configuration    <size-check override; protected branches; notes branch; .ai/ ignored via .git/info/exclude (date);
                               lowered compute minimums or waivers; workflow approval mode>
## Phase log
| Date | Phase | Status | What it produced |
```

The coordinator owns `Status`, `Blocked reason`, `## Delivery parameters`, `## Framework configuration` and
`## Phase log`. Discovery drafts the rest.

Delivery parameters are gathered at P0 **before** discovery and outrank agent judgment. A parameter added or changed
later is a scope change: record it as a new row, note which artifacts it invalidated, and say so at the next gate.

Phase labels: P0 `INTAKE` · P1 `DISCOVERY` · P2 `BRAINSTORMING` · P3–P6 `PLANNING` · P7 `DELIVERY_PLANNING` ·
P8 `AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL` · P9–P10 `IMPLEMENTING` · done `COMPLETE`. `BLOCKED` replaces any of them on a
fail-closed stop. A saved workflow cannot write files, so `Status` only changes between workflows: the coordinator
sets `DISCOVERY` before launching `/shipyard:discover` (P1–P3) and `PLANNING` before `/shipyard:plan` (P5–P7), and
when the workflow returns writes one phase-log row per phase it ran, each row carrying that phase's label.
`BRAINSTORMING` and `DELIVERY_PLANNING` therefore appear in phase-log rows, never as the `Status` line.

## `ARCHITECTURE.md` (architect only)

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
## Current state
## Target state
## Major components + responsibilities
## Dependency direction
## Data and control flow
## Contract boundaries
## Concurrency model
## Failure model
## Lifecycle
## Configuration
## Observability
## Security assumptions
## Migration architecture
## Open architectural questions
```

## `INVARIANTS.md` (architect only)

Properties every current and future slice must preserve. Project-specific — the framework hard-codes none.

The first four lines are the minimum (C-10 `none`). At C-10 `invariants` and above every invariant carries the
extended block, so a non-specialist can read what it means, what it prevents and how it is checked:

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
### INV-001: <name, a sentence a newcomer understands>
Statement:        <the property, precise and testable; glossary terms only>
Rationale:        <why it must hold>
How to verify:    <test, metric, or review check>
Introduced by:    <slice or ADR>
Plain English:    <what it means for a user or operator, one or two lines>        (C-10 invariants and above)
Why it matters:   <the concrete failure it prevents>
Satisfied by:     <one short sequence of events that keeps it>
Violated by:      <one short sequence of events that breaks it; "none found" is a finding, not an answer>
Check:            tier 0: <table or diagram below> · tier 1: <property test or assertion, file :: name>
                  · tier 2: <.ai/formal/INV-001.qnt, invariant name>                 (only the tiers C-10 selects)
Status:           <per tier: PLANNED | PASS (slice <id>) | VIOLATED (trace in <file>) | NOT_RUN (<reason>)>
Tags:             <concurrency | lifecycle | partial-failure | data | security | none>
```

For anything stateful add, under the block, a state-by-event table (`State | Event | Next state | Side effect |
Allowed?`, one row per reachable pair, forbidden pairs included) and a Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` of the same
machine. The reliability reviewer reads the table to find missing cells; the verifier copies the "Violated by"
sequence into a failure case. Properties come from the human's words or an accepted ADR (`SPECIFIED` or
`DERIVED`); an `ASSUMED` property can never carry `model-checked` status.

## `GLOSSARY.md` (discovery)

The project's language, in the project's words. Seeded in `DRAFT` from the request and the code, sharpened during
the P4 grill (never batched up: a term settled in a round is written in that round), and read by the architect,
planner, verifier and code-reviewer. Every later artifact uses these terms; `domain-design` reviews code against
them.

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: none.
# Glossary: <project>

### <Term>
<One or two sentences: what it means in this project, free of implementation detail.>
Avoid: <other words the code or the request uses for the same thing>
Source: <the human's words at P4 round <n> | path:line | request>
```

Only project-specific terms: a word a newcomer could look up in a dictionary does not belong here. Be opinionated:
one term per concept, the rest under `Avoid`. A term the human and the code use differently is a `term` gap in the
grill, not a silent choice.

## `CONSUMERS.md`

One block per consumer.

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
### <consumer name>
Owner:                      Integration mechanism:

Migration state:            NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | NOT_REQUIRED

## `DELIVERY_PLAN.md` (planner; the coordinator updates slice states)

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: PLAN.HUMAN.md.

## `planning/concepts.md`: the brainstorm record (discovery)

Written in two passes. Discovery `SCAN` writes the sealed elephant take before any goldfish runs. Discovery
`SYNTHESIZE` appends everything else and never edits the sealed take. With brainstorm breadth 0 the file holds only
the gap list.

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: PLAN.HUMAN.md.
# Concepts: <project>
Brainstorm breadth: 0 | 1 | 2 (C-6, BB)   Lenses run: <technical, value, contrarian, ...>

## Gap list
### G1  [BLOCKING | DEFERRABLE]
Question:        Why it matters:

```

Gap IDs run `G1..Gn` and match the `gaps[].id` values in the discovery result. `BLOCKING` gaps must be answered at
P4; `DEFERRABLE` gaps are recorded with their recommended default.

## `planning/assumptions.md`

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
### ASM-001
Assumption:       Why it is needed:
Evidence:         Risk if wrong:
Owner:            Status: OPEN | CONFIRMED | REFUTED | ACCEPTED

## `planning/open-questions.md`

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
### Q-001  [BLOCKING_IMPLEMENTATION | DEFERRABLE]   From gap: G<n> | critique finding <id>
Kind:             concept | scope | term | decision | invariant | fact       Depends on: <Q/G ids | none>
Question:         Why it matters:
Evidence so far:  Options:
Recommendation:   <worded so that "yes" accepts it>
Round:            <grill round it was asked in, or SETTLED (from evidence, never asked)>
Answer:           <verbatim human answer, date>
```

`fact` questions are never put to the human: discovery settles them from the repository and records the evidence
in `Answer:` with `SETTLED`.

The planning gate does not require zero open questions. It requires zero **material** unresolved questions — ones that
would make implementation unsafe or cause substantial rework.

## `decisions/ADR-NNN.md`

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: <path to *.HUMAN.md | none>.
# ADR-NNN: <title>
Status: PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | SUPERSEDED by ADR-YYY
Date:   Deciders:

## Context
## Options considered      <with pros and cons>
## Decision
## Consequences            <including what this forecloses>
```

Use an ADR for any decision future agents must not relitigate.

**Short form, for grill answers.** An answer the human gives at P4 becomes an ADR only when all three hold: it is
**hard to reverse**, it would be **surprising without context**, and it is the result of a **real trade-off**.
Otherwise it stays in `open-questions.md`. The short form is enough:

```markdown
> 🤖 AGENT FILE. The human is not expected to read this. Human-facing summary: PLAN.HUMAN.md.
# ADR-NNN: <title>
Status: ACCEPTED   Date: <date>   Deciders: the human (P4 grill, round <n>, gap G<n>)

<One to three sentences: the context, what was decided, and why.>
Their words: "<the human's answer, verbatim>"
Forecloses: <what is now off the table; one line>
```

The coordinator writes it in the round the answer arrives, numbered from ADR-001 upward (ADR-000 stays the scope
record). The architect's four-section form stays for architecture decisions.

**ADR-000 Scope** is written by the coordinator at P4 from the human's concept pick. Context: the top 3 from
`concepts.md`. Options considered: each of them, plus "much smaller or nothing" when the contrarian lens raised it.
Decision: the human's pick, quoted verbatim. Consequences: what is now out of scope. Status `ACCEPTED`, Deciders:
the human. Every later phase treats it as a human decision (source-of-truth rank 1).

## `slices/<id>/SLICE.md` (planner)

The hooks parse `## Expected touch set — code`, `## Expected touch set — tests` and `## Branch`. Use these headings
exactly (em dash; a plain `-` is also accepted) and one repo-relative glob per line as `- path/glob`. `**` is allowed.
The two touch sets must not overlap.

```

Two titles, never interchangeable: the **merge title** (`Merge slice <id>: <title>`) and the **work item title**
(plain English for a backlog). Label both explicitly so neither is pasted into the wrong system.

## `slices/<id>/TEST_PLAN.md` (verifier writes; code-reviewer approves)

The status line is a line that is exactly `Status: DRAFT` or `Status: APPROVED`, within the first 10 lines. The
verifier always writes `Status: DRAFT`. Only the code-reviewer changes it, with one Edit (old `Status: DRAFT`, new
`Status: APPROVED`). The test-plan-gate hook reads this line. See `test-plan.md`.

## `slices/<id>/REVIEW.HUMAN.md`: the merge brief (coordinator)

The human reads top-down and stops early, so the decision comes first and the file stops at one screen
(**≤ 40 lines, hard cap**). The coordinator presents the same content in chat.

```markdown

                                     none. Never omit unverified criteria.
## Evidence                          one line: build PASS, tests PASS (n run), criteria verified n/m,
                                     invariants n/m exercised (k model-checked, bounded N steps) when C-10 is
                                     above none, reviewers <names>, findings fixed n / rebutted n,
                                     rounds n of 3, commit <short sha>. Full record: EVIDENCE.md

Point the human at architectural and semantic risk. Never ask for line-by-line review of mechanical code; that is
exactly the attention this framework exists to reclaim. To review the code itself the human runs
`git diff <feature-branch>...<slice-branch>` — say so in one line in chat, not in the file.

## `slices/<id>/EVIDENCE.md`: the full record behind the brief (coordinator)

Written from the `/shipyard:slice` result. The machine block at the end is that result, verbatim, and must pass
`python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/shipyard_validate.py" slice-workflow-result -`.

## Purpose and why now
## Behaviour changes
## Public contract changes      NONE if none
## Architecture changes         NONE if none
## New abstractions             <each with its justification>
## Consumers affected           NONE if none
## Compatibility impact
## Rollout impact

## Test plan
Status: APPROVED by code-reviewer after <n> revision(s)   ACs covered: n/m   Not verifiable here: <list | NONE>

## Agent review
| Reviewer | Routed because | BLOCKING | MAJOR | MINOR | NOTE | Findings file |
Reviewers not routed: <role + why not, for every role in registry.routing.slice>

## Findings
Fixed: n   Rebutted (accepted by reviewer): n   Carried to the human: n   Full list: FINDINGS.json

## Verification
Scope check:        IN_SCOPE | DRIFT   <out-of-set paths and undeclared contract changes>
Build:              PASS | FAIL
Static analysis:    PASS | FAIL | NOT_APPLICABLE
Unit tests:         PASS | FAIL   (run: N, failures: N)
Integration tests:  PASS | FAIL | NOT_APPLICABLE
Validation tiers:   <each planned tier: PASS | FAIL | NOT_RUN | AWAITING_APPROVAL + why>
Formal (C-10):      <tier; INV ids checked; INV ids NOT_RUN with reason; "none" when C-10 is none>
Command used:       <exact command, duration>

## `slices/<id>/FINDINGS.json` (coordinator)

The merged, deduplicated `findings` array from the last `/shipyard:slice` result, written verbatim: a JSON array of
objects, each valid against `contracts/finding.schema.json`. It replaces the previous run's file. It is the record
a resumed session and P10 read; the per-reviewer `findings/` files are working copies.

## `.ai/returns/` (coordinator)

One file per direct Agent call: `<phase>-<agent-name>-<mode>[-<slice>].json`, holding the call's fenced ```json
block, validated with `shipyard_validate.py <contract-stem> <file>`. Kept for audit and resume.
